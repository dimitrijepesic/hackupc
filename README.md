# CodeGraph

Interactive AST-based call-graph explorer. Import a codebase, see which functions call which (and under what conditions), click to read code + AI summaries, and add new nodes to plan changes.

## How It Works

1. **Import** a repo (GitHub URL or local upload)
2. **tree-sitter** parses the AST across Python, JS/TS, Java, Go
3. **Call graph** is built — nodes are functions, edges are calls, labeled with conditions (if/else/for/try)
4. **Interactive visualization** — explore the graph, click nodes to see source code
5. **AI summaries** — Gemini 2.5 explains what each function does in context
6. **Modify** — add nodes manually or describe changes to AI, see the updated graph, run tests

| State | Zustand + TanStack Query |
| Backend | Flask (Python) |
| AST | tree-sitter (multi-language) |
| AI | Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| Storage | Filesystem (no database) |
